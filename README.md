# EMJN-3D-Printer
Yet another 3D printer design.
By Ella Torres, Mayisha Delwar, John H. Ng, & Nicolas Yusim.

Inspired by the Ultimaker S3 drive mechanism and with several broken 3D printers, we set out to put those parts to use. Lightweight cartesian drive with bowden extruder achieves up to 150mm/s speeds.

V1 released in June 2019.
V2 released in October 2020.
